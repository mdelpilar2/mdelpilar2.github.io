My name is Pilar Ramirez, a Ph.D. Student in History at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I am working on religious missions and linguistic policies in the New Kingdom of Granada. I received undergraduate degrees in History in the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and Philology in the Universidad de Antioquia.
